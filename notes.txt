FLUX:

Bootstrap a repo: 

flux bootstrap github --owner=gustavonlorenzo --repository=my-flux-repo --path=clusters/my-cluster --branch=master --personal

^^ Also useful for changing up the main branch of your repo.

Pod was getting authorization errors when pulling image. followed above url which boiled down to:

1. manually login to registry to get a ~/.docker/config.json file.
2. create a k8s secret using the encoded auth secret in that file.
3. set up deployment.yml to use the imagePullSecrets.
4. Flux is happy.
